# OSI Model Application

This application is a Python implementation of the OSI model. The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to describe how different network protocols interact and work together to provide network services. It's divided into seven layers, each with a specific function.

## Layers

1. Physical Layer: This is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It's responsible for the actual transmission of raw bitstream over the physical medium (e.g., cables, wireless signals).

2. Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer. It provides error-free transfer of frames from one node to another.

3. Network Layer: This layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.

4. Transport Layer: This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control.

5. Session Layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications at each end.

6. Presentation Layer: This layer transforms data into a form that the application layer can accept. It's responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.

7. Application Layer: This is the topmost layer in the OSI model. It provides a set of interfaces for the application to use the network services.

## Structure

The application is structured into three main directories:

- `src`: This directory contains the Python scripts for each layer of the OSI model.

- `tests`: This directory contains the test scripts for each layer.

- `docs`: This directory contains the documentation for the application.

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the application and run the following command:

```
bash python main.py
```


This will start the application and it will begin processing data through the OSI model.
